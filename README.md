# Source Bindmaker

## Disclaimer

This is the first time I've ever used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, so if it seems roughly put together, that's why.

## Info

Source Bindmaker is used to create chat spam scripts for TF2 specifically. These scripts only work if the `wait` command is enabled on the server. As of July 2020, the `wait` command is enabled on official Valve servers.

## Usage

1. Input the following information:

    - Name: The name of your chat spam bind.
    - Command: The command that you will type in the console to trigger the spam. This can also be a keyboard key (i.e. INS for the insert key)
    - Prefix: A short 3 to 5 letter string of characters that has to be unique (Any other chat bind cannot share this prefix. Otherwise, only one of them will work.)
    - Wait: The number of frames between each line of spam.

2. Copy the output from the black box.

3. Go to your TF2 `autoexec.cfg` and paste.

4. Launch your game (or if you're already in-game, enter `exec autoexec` in the console) and you'll be able to use your chat spam bind with the command/key you configured.
